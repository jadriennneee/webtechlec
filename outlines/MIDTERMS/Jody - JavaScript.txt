JAVASCRIPT Execution Environment

JavaScript - It provides code in which users can interact with the webpage.
		   - It is a programming language that allows the implementation of 
		     complex functionalities on websites.
		   - It is well-known as the scripting language for Web pages.
		   - It is standardized at Ecma International (http://www.ecma-international.org/)
		   		* Ecma International -  the European association for standardizing 
		   		  						information and communication systems to 
		   		  						deliver a standardized, international 
		   		  						programming language based on JavaScript.

		   - The standardized version of JavaScript is ECMAScript.
		   		* ECMAScript Standard - ECMA-262 Specification 
		   		  (https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)	
		   		  					  - It was approved by ISO as ISO-16262
		   		  (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:16262:ed-3:v1:en)


	DIFFERENT WAYS OF JavaScript PLACEMENT
		1. External - Standard approach
			* defer - execution is deferred when script has been downloaded.
			* async - JS can execute while HTML is parsing

		2. Embedded/Internal - codes outside the function is automatically executed.

		3. Inline

			ex:
				<p><button onclick = 'alert("You Clicked Me!");'> Click Me! </button></p>

			*<noscript> - alternative the browser will have if scripting is not supported

	> (Traditional) Browser Object Model(BOM) API (non-standardized)
		- It is a set of objects that comprises various elements of the browser.

		BOM Hierarchy
		A. Window
			- It is the top-level object of the hierarchy.

			Methods:
				1. alert() - A method of the browser's window that posts a message dialog.
				2. open() - A method of the browser's window that opens a new browser window.
				3. close() - A method f the browser's window that closes the window.

			Properties:
				1. name - It refers to the name of the window.
				2. defaultStatus - It refers to the text in the status bar.
				3. outerwidth and outerheight - It refers to the window extents.

		B. Navigator
			- It represents information about the browser and the underlying Operating System.

			Methods:
				1. javaEnabled() - It returns true or false.

			Properties:
				1. appCodeName - It refers to the code name of the browser.
				2. appName - It refers to the name of the browser.
				3. appVersion - It refers to the platform and version of the browser.

		C. Screen
			- It is the information about the display capabilities of the Client PC running the Browser.

			Properties:
				1. availHeight, availWidth, height, width 
					– It refers to the metrics of the display screen size.

				2. bufferDepth, colorDepth, pixelDepth 
					– It refers to the metrics of the color palette.

				3. deviceXDPI, deviceYDPI, logicalXDPI, logicalYDPI 
					- It refers to the number of dots per inch of the display screen.

		D. History
			- It contains information of the recently visited sites.

			Methods: 
				1. back() - It loads the previous URL in the history list.
				2. forward() - It loads the next URL in the history list.
				3. go() - It loads a specific page in the history list.

			Properties:
				1. length - It refers to the number of elements in the history list.

		E. Location
			- It contains information about the current URL.

			Methods:
				1. assign() - It loads a new document.
				2. reload() - It reloads the current document.
				3. replace() - It replaces the current document with a new document.

			Properties:
				1. host, hostname, href, pathname, port 
					– It refers to the hostname/port number/path/port/URL information.
				2. protocol 
					– It refers to the protocol of the current URL.
				3. hash, search 
					– It refers to the URL from the hash sign/question mark.

		F. Document
			- It represents the current Web page of its entire contents.
			- It comprises the Document Object Model (DOM).

	> Document Object Model (DOM) API
		- An API that allows access to the HTML document from within scripts associated
		  with the Web page.
		- It is represented by the DOM tree which contains nodes.
		- It defines how documents are accessed and manipulated as well as its logical structure.
		- Standards such as W3C DOM and WHATWG DOM are implemented in most modern browsers.
			* W3C DOM - https://www.w3.org/DOM/
			* WHATWG DOM - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/

		- It is also accessed via the Document Object Property of the global window object.

		FUNCTIONALITIES:
			A. Retrieve references to nodes (or node collection) in the DOM

				ex:
					1. getElementById()
					2. getElementsByTagName(). getElementsByClassName()
					3. querySelector(), querySelectorAll()

			B. Traverse the DOM type (from a given node)

				ex:
					1. parentNode, parentElement
					2. childNodes, children
					3. firstChild, lastChild

			C. Copy or construct nodes

				ex:
					1. createElement(), createTextNode(), etc.
					2. cloneNode(), importNode()
						* cloneNode() - creates a copy of node

							TYPES OF CLONING:
								a. deep cloning - clone is set to true.
												- It creates a copy of the
												  entire structure.

								b. shallow cloning - clone is set to false.
												   - It creates a copy of the 
												     outer structure only.

			D. Manipulate the DOm tree

				ex:
					1. appendChild()
					2. insertBefore()
					3. replaceChild()
					4. removeChild()
					5. adoptNode()

			E. miscellaneous attributes and methods

				ex:
					1. nodeType
					2. nodeName
					3. nodeValue
