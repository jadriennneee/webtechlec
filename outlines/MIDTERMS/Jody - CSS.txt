CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)
	- It is used to specify how websites/documents are displayed/presented.
	  It is purposely used for presentation aspects such as for fonts, colors, 
	  and screen layouts of HTML, XML, SVG, MathML documents and other documents
	  using a markup language.
	  	** Mark-up Language - languages used to indicate how documents are presented
	  						  or structured. It uses tags to define the structure
	  						  of the document.


VERSION HISTORY (a.k.a 'The CSS Saga')
	1994 - Hakon Wium Lee released the draft of 'Cascading HTML Style Sheets' along with
		   Bert Bos who was, at that time, developing a browser name Argo, which supports its own
		   stylesheet.
		 - The proposal fo 'Cascading HTML Style Sheets' was launched.
	1996 - CSS Level 1 was published as a W3C Recommendation
			> CSS Level 1 supports the following fetures:
				- font properties
				- text attributes
				- alignment of text
				- tables
				- images
				- text colors
				- backgrounds
				- word spacing
				- margins
				- borders
				- padding
				- positioning
		 - Mozilla browser was the first ever browser to support CSS
	1998 - CSS Level 2 became a W3C Recommendation
		 - Features which were not included in CSS Level 1 were added to CSS Level 2
		 	> CSS Level 2 added the following fetures:
		 		- z-index
		 		- media types
		 		- bidirectional text
		 		- absolute, relative and fixed positioning

		 - The new browser 'Opera' was released which supports CSS

	2011 - W3C released CSS Level 2.1 which fixes errors/bugs in CSS Level 2 and fixed
		   its browser function capabilities.

	Around 2012 - CSS Level 3 was released which was a modular approach to CSS Development
				  (as opposed to the 'monolithic' specification of CSS Level 2.1)
				  > The following are the 4 modules which were released as formal recommendation:
				  	- color
				  	- selectors level 3
				  	- namespaces
				  	- media queries

HTML Style Sheets

	> Three Main source styles for HTML Documents:
		A. Author Style
			A.1 External
				- a.k.a 'Linked Stylesheet' which is recommended because it provides easier caching
				  and it can be edited easily as well as it can be used in multiple sites and documents.
				- These are stylesheets separated from the HTML documents.
			A.2 Embedded
				- a.k.a 'Internal Stylesheet' which is not very much recommended because since it is internal, 
				  it cannot be used by other sites/documents.
				- These are style sheets defined within the HTML Document.
			A.3 Inline
				- These style sheets are defined within the HTML tags.

		B. User Styles
			- These are non-standard styles such that it allows users to provide their own style sheet or preferred 
			  layout for the website. 
			- Some browsers also provide alternative styles through plugins and extensions. For example, Chrome's
			  extension called 'Stylish Extension' provides different themes for different websites which the users
			  can choose from.

		C. User Agent Styles
			- Browsers provide their own/default style sheet in rendering the websites.

CSS Statements
	1. At-Rules 
		- these are commonly denoted with an annotation '@'
		- example:
			> @charset
			> @import
			> @namespace
			> @font-face
				- At-Rule used for defining font-styles which are typically Google Fonts
			> @Keyframes
				- At-Rule used for animations

		* Nested At-Rules
			- These are At-Rules within an At-Rule
			- example: @media

	2. CSS Rule Sets
		- a.k.a 'CSS Rules'/ 'Style Rules'
