CSS Declaration
  ~Properties
	-Shorthand Properties
		-allows authors to specify values of several properties with a single property.
		..e.g. backgroung, font, etc.
	-vendor specific extension(a.k.a vendor prefixes)
		-used by browser vendirs as a prefix for the names of experimental or non-experimental CSS
		properties; lately, vendors are moving away from vendor prefixes in favor of user-controlled
		flags or preference.
		..e.g --webkit--,-moz-,-o-,-ms-,etc.
	-custom properties a.k.a. CSS variable(experimental)
		-property names prefixed with "--" ,representing a value that can be reused throughout prefixed.
		
  ~values
	-value processing
		-declared -applied to an element are collected, for each property on each element.
		-cascaded - represents the result of the cascade: it is the declared value that wins the cascade (is sorted first in the output of the cascade).
		-specified - the value of a given property that the style sheet authors intended for that element.
		-computed - is the result of resolving the specified value as defined in the “Computed Value” line of the property definition table
				  -is the value that is transferred from parent to child during inheritance.
		-used -is the result of taking the computed value and completing any remaining calculations to make it the absolute theoretical value used in the layout of the document
		-actual - principle ready to be used, but a user agent may not be able to make use of the value in a given environment.
