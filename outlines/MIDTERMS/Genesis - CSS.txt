HTML Stylesheets
-Style sheets represent a major breakthrough for Web page designers, expanding their ability to improve the appearance of their pages

Three sources of styles for HTML Documents:
   AUTHOR STYLES 
        a)External
            -are often associated with HTML documents using the <link rel="stylesheet"> element, but it is important to use the element's title attribute properly.
            -a file that contains only CSS code and is saved with a ".css" file extension
        
        b)Embedded
            -a CSS style specification method and is only used with HTML. 
            -an entire stylesheet can be embedded in an HTML Document using the Style element in the Head block of an HTML file.

            Sample code:
            <head>
          		<style TYPE="text/css">
    				<!--[CSS Style Sheet]-->					
    	  		</style>
         	</head>
        
        c)Inline
        	-style sheets that are defined within the HTML Tags

     		Sample code:

     		<h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This is a heading</h1>

   USER STYLES

        Example: 
           Stylish
              -an open-source browser extension that can apply a user-supplied style sheet to a web page, in addition to the Cascading Style Sheets provided by the website itself, to customize and personalize the appearance of the page.
