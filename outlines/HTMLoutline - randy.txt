HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)
-language used to mark up document(i.e webpages) in the World Wide Web
-application of SGML(Standard Generalize Markup Language)
-histprically, HTML was used to specify the STRUCTURE AND CONTENT of webpages as well as their presentation
-modern web development practice, however, uses HTML solely for SEMANTIC specification of webpages structure and content, with presentational aspects being delegated to style sheets.

-initially developed at CERN(European Organization for Nuclear Research), then the IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force), then W3C, and then also the WHATWG(Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)
